The goal of the project is to enable generic audit logging for java applications and to describe the schema and format for audit logging, as well as best practices for audit logging, for other commons platforms such as:
  * Ruby on Rails
  * .NET

Audit Logs can be stored in a database or in log files.

This is NOT meant as a replacement for the regular logging systems such as log4j.  It can be considered an abstraction on top of the normal logging that enables better business level logging of a deployed application or applications.
